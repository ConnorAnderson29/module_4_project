# Module 4 Project

## Business Case
We are creating a web application for aspiring writers and comic enthusiasts. Our application uses character origin stories to predict whether the character will become a hero or villain. Users can test their characters against our model and use our feedback to enhance their origin stories. This will help writers create deeper plots, stronger characters and overall higher quality content

Objectives:
- Acquire Marvel origin story using Wikipedia API. 
- Use neural network to extract deep features
- Perform classification modeling on deep features
- Evaluate and compare model types
- Deploy production model


Project Outline:
- Day One: Source and Collect Data
- Day Two: Data exploration and understanding. Begin modeling processes. 
- Day Three: 
- Day Four:
- Day Five:
