# Module 4 Project

## Business Case
We are creating a web application where aspiring writers and comic enthusiasts can test and adapt their characters origin stories. Our application reads User input data and predicts whether or not a character will end up becoming a hero or a villain. Users can use our feedback to enhance their origin stories to create deeper plots, stronger characters and overall higher quality content. 

Project Outline:
- Day One: Source and Collect Data

- Day Three: 
- Day Four:
