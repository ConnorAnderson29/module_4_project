of Abomination were later used by the US Hulk Operations to graft to the corpse of Rick Jones that revives him as an AbominationABomblike creature that Dr Charlene McGowan calls Subject B    Powers

transforming and cannot change back into human form He also possesses gills enabling underwater breathing and he can enter a state of suspended animation when bereft of oxygen for long periods Initially the Abomination is twice as strong as the Hulk but unlike the Hulk his strength does not increasedecrease in proportion to level of anger with the result that the Hulk is able to gain an advantage over Blonsky if the fight takes a sufficient amount of time for his anger to increase After being further empowered by AmatsuMikaboshi the Abomination is considerably larger than before can project hellfire and is strong enough to rip off the shell of his successor ABomb something which the Red Hulk had previously been unable to do After his second resurrection by the Illuminati dubbed Order of the Shield the cloned Abomination gains further augmentation through Banners biological grafts Abomination gains the ability to track the Hulk anywhere in the world at will Another feature is

       " {'bio': '   Creation  In 1940 writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume I wrote the name Super American at the bottom of the page Simon said in his autobiography and then decided  No it didnt work There were too many Supers around Captain America had a good sound to it There werent a lot of captains in comics It was as easy as that The boy companion was simply named Bucky after my friend Bucky Pierson a star on our high school basketball team Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the goahead and directed that a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one characters stories Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner artist Jack Kirby could handle the workload alone  I didnt have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue   There were two young artists from Connecticut that had made a strong impression on me Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other Actually their work was not too far from that of Kirbys If they worked on it and if one inker tied the three styles together I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform The two Als were eager to join in on the new Captain America book but Jack Kirby was visibly upset Youre still number one Jack I assured him Its just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue Ill make the deadline Jack promised Ill pencil it all myself and make the deadline I hadnt expected this kind of reaction   but I acceded to Kirbys wishes and it turned out was lucky that I did There might have been two Als but there was only one Jack Kirby  I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds Kirby did his thing building the muscular anatomy adding ideas and popping up the action as only he could Then he tightened up the penciled drawings adding detailed backgrounds faces and figures  Al Lieberman would ink that first issue which was lettered by Simon and Kirbys regular letterer Howard FergusonSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable The opponents to the war were all quite well organized We wanted to have our say too    Golden Age  Captain America Comics 1 — coverdated March 1941 and on sale December 20 1940 a year before the attack on Pearl Harbor but a full year into World War II — showed the protagonist punching Nazi leader Adolf Hitler it sold nearly one million copies While most readers responded favorably to the comic some took objection Simon noted When the first issue came out we got a lot of   threatening letters and hate mail Some people really opposed what Cap stood for The threats which included menacing groups of people loitering out on the street outside of the offices proved so serious that police protection was posted with New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacting Simon and Kirby to give his supportThough preceded as a patriotically themed superhero by MLJs The Shield Captain America immediately became the most prominent and enduring of that wave of superheroes introduced in American comic books prior to and during World War II as evidenced by the unusual move at the time of premiering the character in his own title instead of an anthology title first This popularity drew the attention and a complaint from MLJ that the characters triangular shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of their Shield character In response Goodman had Simon and Kirby create a distinctive round shield for issue 2 which went on to become an iconic element of the character With his sidekick Bucky Captain America faced Nazis Japanese and other threats to wartime America and the Allies Stanley Lieber now better known as Stan Lee contributed to the character in issue 3 in the filler text story Captain America Foils the Traitors Revenge which introduced the characters use of his shield as a returning throwing weapon Captain America soon became Timelys most popular character and even had a fanclub called the Sentinels of LibertyCirculation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the period After the Simon and Kirby team moved to DC Comics in late 1941 having produced Captain America Comics through issue 10 January 1942 Al Avison and Syd Shores became regular pencillers of the celebrated title with one generally inking over the other The character was featured in All Winners Comics 1–19 Summer 1941 – Fall 1946 Marvel Mystery Comics 80–84 and 86–92 USA Comics 6–17 Dec 1942 – Fall 1945 and All Select Comics 1–10 Fall 1943 – Summer 1946 In the postwar era with the popularity of superheroes fading Captain America led Timelys first superhero team the AllWinners Squad in its two published adventures in All Winners Comics 19 and 21 Fall–Winter 1946 there was no issue 20 After Bucky was shot and wounded in a 1948 Captain America story he was succeeded by Captain Americas girlfriend Betsy Ross who became the superheroine Golden Girl Captain America Comics ran until issue 73 July 1949 at which time the series was retitled Captain Americas Weird Tales for two issues with the finale being a horrorsuspense anthology issue with no superheroes Atlas Comics attempted to revive its superhero titles when it reintroduced Captain America along with the original Human Torch and the SubMariner in Young Men 24 Dec 1953 Billed as Captain America Commie Smasher Captain America appeared during the next year in Young Men 24–28 and Mens Adventures 27–28 as well as in issues 76–78 of an eponymous title Atlas attempted superhero revival was a commercial failure and the characters title was canceled with Captain America 78 Sept 1954    Silver and Bronze Age   In the Human Torch story titled Captain America in Marvel Comics Strange Tales 114 Nov 1963 writereditor Stan Lee and artist and coplotter Jack Kirby depicted the brash young Fantastic Four member Johnny Storm the Human Torch in an exhibition performance with Captain America described as a legendary World War II and 1950s superhero who has returned after many years of apparent retirement The 18page story ends with this Captain America revealed as an impostor it was actually the villain the Acrobat a former circus performer the Torch had defeated in Strange Tales 106 who broke two thieves out of jail hoping to draw the police away while trying to rob the local bank Afterward Storm digs out an old comic book in which Captain America is shown to be Steve Rogers A caption in the final panel says this story was a test to see if readers would like Captain America to return According to Lee fan response to the tryout was very enthusiasticCaptain

Joe Simon sued the owners of Marvel Comics asserting that he—not Marvel—was legally entitled to renew the copyright upon the expiration of the original 28year term The two parties settled out of court with Simon agreeing to a statement that the character had been created under terms of employment by the publisher and therefore it was work for hire owned by themIn 1999 Simon filed to claim the copyright to Captain America under a provision of the Copyright Act of 1976 which allowed the original creators of works that had been sold to corporations to reclaim them after the original 56year copyright term but not the longer term enacted by the new legislation had expired Marvel Entertainment challenged the claim arguing that the settlement of Simons 1966 suit made the character ineligible for termination of the copyright transfer Simon and Marvel settled out of court in 2003 in a deal that paid Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing use of the character    Fictional character biography     20th century     1940s   Steven Rogers was born in the Lower East Side of Manhattan New York City in 1920 to poor Irish immigrants Sarah and Joseph Rogers Joseph died when Steve was a child and Sarah died of pneumonia while Steve was a teen By early 1940 before Americas entry into World War II Rogers is a tall scrawny fine arts student specializing in illustration and a comic book writer and artist Disturbed by Adolf Hitlers rise to power Rogers attempts to enlist but is rejected due to his frail body His resolution attracts the notice of US Army General Chester Phillips and Project Rebirth Rogers is used as a test subject for the SuperSoldier project receiving a special serum made by Dr Josef Reinstein later retroactively changed to a code name for the scientist Abraham ErskineThe serum is a success and transforms Steve Rogers into a nearly perfect human being with peak strength agility stamina and intelligence The success of the program leaves Erskine wondering about replicating the experiment on other human beings The process itself has been inconsistently detailed While in the original material Rogers is shown receiving injections of the SuperSerum when the origin was retold in the 1960s the Comic Code Authority had already put a veto over graphic description of drug intake and abuse and thus the SuperSerum was retconned into an oral formulaErskine refused to write down every crucial element of the treatment leaving behind a flawed imperfect knowledge of the steps Thus when the Nazi spy Heinz Kruger killed him Erskines method of creating new SuperSoldiers died Captain America in his first act after his transformation avenges Erskine In the 1941 origin story and in Tales of Suspense 63 Kruger dies when running into machinery but is not killed by Rogers in the Captain America 109 and 255 revisions Rogers causes the spys death by punching him into machineryUnable to create new SuperSoldiers and willing to hide the Project Rebirth fiasco the American government casts Rogers as a patriotic superhero able to counter the menace of the Red Skull as a counterintelligence agent He is supplied with a patriotic uniform of his own design a bulletproof shield a personal side arm and the codename Captain America while posing as a clumsy infantry private at Camp Lehigh in Virginia He forms a friendship with the camps teenage mascot James Buchanan Bucky BarnesBarnes learns of Rogers dual identity and offers to keep the secret if he can become Captain Americas sidekick During their adventures Franklin D Roosevelt presents Captain America with a new shield forged from an alloy of steel and vibranium fused by an unknown catalyst so effective that it replaces his own firearm Throughout World War II Captain America and Bucky fight the Nazi menace both on their own and as members of the superhero team the Invaders as seen in the 1970s comic of the same name Captain America fights in numerous battles in World War II primarily as a member of 1st Battalion 26th Infantry Regiment Blue Spaders Captain America battles a number of criminal menaces on American soil including a wide variety of costumed villains the Wax Man the Hangman the Fang the Black Talon and the White Death among others In addition to Bucky Captain America was occasionally assisted by the Sentinels of Liberty Sentinels of Liberty was the title given to members of the Captain America Comics fan club who Captain America sometimes addressed as an aside or as characters in the Captain America Comics stories In late April 1945 during the closing days of World War II Captain America and Bucky try to stop the villainous Baron Zemo from destroying an experimental drone plane Zemo launches the plane with an armed explosive on it with Rogers and Barnes in hot pursuit The pair reaches the plane just before take off When Bucky tries to defuse the bomb it explodes in midair Rogers is hurled into the freezing waters of the North Atlantic Both are presumed dead though it is later revealed that neither had died    Late 1940s to 1950s  Captain America appeared in comics for the next few years changing from World War IIera hero fighting the Nazis to confronting the United States newest enemy Communism The revival of the character in the mid1950s was shortlived and events during that time period are later retconned to show that multiple people operated using the code name to explain the changes in the character These post World War II successors are listed as William Naslund and Jeffrey Mace The last of these other official Captains William Burnside was a history graduate enamored with the Captain America mythos having his appearance surgically altered to resemble Rogers and legally changing his name to Steve Rogers becoming the new 1950s Captain America He administered to himself and his pupil James Jack Monroe a flawed incomplete copy of the SuperSerum which made no mention about the necessary VitaRay portion of the treatment As a result while Burnside and Monroe became the new Captain America and Bucky they became violently paranoid often raving about innocent people being communist sympathizers during the height of the Red Scare of the 1950s Their insanity forced the US government to place them in indefinite cryogenic storage until they could be cured of their mental illness Monroe would later be cured and assume the Nomad identity    1960s to 1970s  Years later the superhero team the Avengers discovers Steve Rogers body in the North Atlantic After he revives they piece together that Rogers has been preserved in a block of ice since 1945 surviving because of his enhancements from Project Rebirth The block began to melt after the SubMariner enraged that an Inuit tribe is worshipping the frozen figure throws it into the ocean Rogers accepts membership in the Avengers and his experience in individual combat service and his time with the Invaders makes him a valuable asset He quickly assumes leadership and has typically returned to that position throughout the teams history  Captain America is plagued by guilt for having been unable to prevent Buckys death Although he takes the young Rick Jones who closely resembles Bucky under his tutelage he refuses for some time to allow Jones to take up the Bucky identity not wishing to be responsible for another youths death Insisting that his hero move on from that loss Jones convinces Rogers to let him don the Bucky costume but this partnership lasts only a short time a disguised Red Skull impersonating Rogers with the help of the Cosmic Cube drives Jones away Rogers reunites with his old war comrade Nick Fury who is similarly wellpreserved due to the Infinity Formula As a result Rogers regularly undertakes missions for the security agency SHIELD for which Fury is public director Through Fury Rogers befriends Sharon Carter a SHIELD agent with whom he eventually begins a romantic relationship Rogers later meets and trains Sam Wilson who becomes the superhero the Falcon the first AfricanAmerican superhero in mainstream comic books The characters established an enduring friendship and adventuring partnership sharing the series title for some time as Captain America and the Falcon The two later encounter the revived but still insane 1950s Captain America Although Rogers and the Falcon defeat the faux Rogers and Jack Monroe Rogers becomes deeply disturbed that he could have suffered his counterparts fate During this period Rogers temporarily gains super strengthThe series dealt with the Marvel Universes version of the Watergate scandal making Rogers so uncertain about his role that he abandons his Captain America identity in favor of one called Nomad emphasizing the words meaning as man without a country During this time several men unsuccessfully assume the Captain America identity Rogers eventually reassumes it after coming to consider that the identity could be a symbol of American ideals and not its government its a personal conviction epitomized when he later confronted a corrupt Army officer attempting to manipulate him by appealing to his loyalty Im loyal to nothing General   except the American Dream Jack Monroe cured of his mental instability later takes up the Nomad alias Sharon Carter is believed to have been killed while under the mind control of Dr Faustus    1980s to 1990s   The 1980s included a run by writer Roger Stern and artist John Byrne Stern had Rogers consider a run for President of the United States in Captain America 250 June 1980 an idea originally developed by Roger McKenzie and Don Perlin Stern in his capacity as editor of the title originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept McKenzie and Perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at Sterns insistence Stern additionally introduced a new love interest law student Bernie Rosenthal in Captain America 248 Aug 1980Writer J M DeMatteis revealed the true face and full origin of the Red Skull in Captain America 298–300 and had Captain America take on Jack Monroe Nomad as a partner for a time Around this time the heroes gathered by the Beyonder elect Rogers as leader during their stay on Battleworld in the 1984 miniseries Secret Wars Homophobia is dealt with as Rogers runs into a childhood friend named Arnold Roth who is gayMark Gruenwald became the writer of the series with issue 307

and the Serpent Society Other Gruenwald characters included Diamondback Super Patriot and Demolition Man Gruenwald explored numerous political and social themes as well such as extreme idealism when Captain America fights the antinationalist terrorist FlagSmasher and vigilantism when he hunts the murderous Scourge of the UnderworldRogers receives a large backpay reimbursement dating back to his disappearance at the end of World War II and a government commission orders him to work directly for the US government Already troubled by the corruption he had encountered with the Nuke incident in New York City Rogers chooses instead to resign his identity and then takes the alias of the Captain A replacement Captain America John Walker struggles to emulate Rogers ideals until pressure from hidden enemies helps to drive Walker insane Rogers returns to the Captain America identity while a recovered Walker becomes the US AgentSometime afterward Rogers avoids the explosion of a methamphetamine lab but the drug triggers a chemical reaction in the SuperSoldier serum in his system To combat the reaction Rogers has the serum removed from his body and trains constantly to maintain his physical condition A retcon later establishes that the serum was not a drug per se which would have metabolized out of his system but in fact a viruslike organism that effected a biochemical and genetic change This additionally explained how nemesis the Red Skull who at the time inhabited a body cloned from Rogers cells has the formula in his body Because of his altered biochemistry Rogers body begins to deteriorate and for a time he must wear a powered exoskeleton and is eventually placed again in suspended animation During this time he is given a transfusion of blood from the Red Skull which cures his condition and stabilizes the SuperSoldier virus in his system Captain America returns to crime fighting and the AvengersFollowing Gruenwalds departure from the series Mark Waid took over and resurrected Sharon Carter as Caps love interest The title was then relaunched under Rob Liefeld as Cap became part of the Heroes Reborn universe for 13 issues before another relaunch restored Waid to the title in an arc that saw Cap lose his shield for a time using an energy based shield as a temporary replacement Following Waids run Dan Jurgens took over and introduced new foe Protocide a failed recipient of the Super Soldier serum prior to the experiment that successfully created Rogers Some time after this Rogers original shield was retrieved but subtle damage sustained during the battle with the Beyonder resulted in it being shattered and a vibranium cancer being triggered that would destroy all vibranium in the world with Rogers nearly being forced to destroy the shield before a confrontation with the villain Klaw saw Klaws attacks unwittingly repair the shields fractured molecular bonds and negate the cancer    21st century     2000s  In the

the help of the SMan Honest John he managed to even manipulate ThorThe Red Skulls skills were still erratic and could not completely control Captain America an attack against him was enough of a

encounter with an alternate Logan from Earth807128 After defeating Logan and bringing him to Alberta Canada Rogers tried to reassure Logan that this was not his past by showing him the adamantiumfrozen body of Earth616s Logan This sight reminds Logan of the need to enjoy being alive rather than brooding over the ghosts of his past Although he told Steve Rogers what he had experienced in his timeline Logan declined Steves offer of help    Alternate timeline Hydra duplicate  During the 2016 Avengers Standoff storyline Steve Rogers learns from Rick Jones that SHIELD has established Pleasant Hill a gated community where they use Kobik to transform villains into ordinary citizens When Rogers is brought to Pleasant Hill he confronts Maria Hill about the Kobik project Their argument is interrupted when Baron Helmut Zemo and Fixer restore the inmates to normal After Hill is injured Rogers convinces Zemo to let Hill get medical attention Rogers is then escorted to Dr

aftermath of the incident Steve and Sam plan to keep what happened at Pleasant Hill under wraps for the time beingIn Captain America Steve Rogers 1 July 2016 the final panel apparently revealed that Rogers has been a Hydra doubleagent since his early youth This is subsequently revealed to be the result of Kobiks restoration of Rogers youth as she had been taught by the Red Skull that Hydra was good for the world and having the mind of a fouryearold child Kobik changed reality so that Rogers would be the greatest man he could be believing Hydra to be good Kobik permanently altered his memories so that Rogers believed that he had always been a member of Hydra Some of Rogers original heroic attributes remain intact such as covering the death of another Hydra member within SHIELD Erik Selvig as well as knowing of Jack Flags tragic life and his immortality which is why Steve pushes him from Zemos airplane resulting in coma not death Additionally it is revealed that Rogers abusive father Joseph was actually killed by Hydra and that Hydra deceived him into thinking Joseph died of a heart attack It is also revealed that Rogers witnessed his mother Sarah being killed by Sinclairs Hydra goons and kidnapped him which is the reason why Steve held a grudge towards Hydras evilness and plans to kill the Red Skulls clone and restore Hydras lost honor As part of his longterm plans Steve further compromised Sam Wilsons current image as the Captain America by using his greater familiarity with the shield to deliberately put Wilson in a position where he would be unable to use the shield to save a senator from FlagSmasher with the final goal of demoralizing Sam to the point where he will return the shield to Rogers of his own free will not wanting to kill Wilson and risk creating a martyrDuring the 2016 Civil War II storyline with the discovery of new Inhuman Ulysses – who has the ability to predict the future by calculating complex patterns – Rogers has set out to prevent Ulysses from learning of his true plans and allegiance Rogers does this by forcing certain predictions on him such as anonymously providing Bruce Banner with new gamma research to provoke a vision that would drive the Avengers to kill Banner although this plan has apparently backfired with a recent vision showing the new SpiderMan standing over the dead Steve Rogers Despite this revelation Rogers presents himself as the voice of reason by allowing SpiderMan to flee with Thor This inspires doubt in Tony Stark for his current stance by suggesting that he is just acting against Danvers because he does not like being top dog He then goes to Washington DC the location seen in Ulysses vision to talk to SpiderMan who was trying to understand the vision like he was When Captain Marvel attempts to arrest SpiderMan Tony wearing the War Machine armor confronts her and the two begin to fightLater Rogers goes to Sokovia and joins forces with Black Widow to liberate freedom fighters from a prison so they can reclaim their country After that he goes to his base where Doctor Selvig expresses concern of his plan to kill the Red Skull He then reveals that he has Baron Zemo in a cell planning to recruit him He eventually kills the Skull after the villain is captured by the Unity Squad and the Xavier brain fragment extracted by the Beast Rogers throwing the Skull out of a window over a cliff after Sin and Crossbones affirm their new allegiance to RogersIn the 2017 Secret Empire storyline Rogers as the head of SHIELD uses a subsequent alien invasion and a mass supervillain assault in order to seize control of the United States He neutralizes the superheroes that might oppose him and seeks the Cosmic Cube to bring about a reality in which Hydra won World War II When Rick smuggles information about the Cubes rewriting of Rogers reality to the remaining free Avengers a disheveled bearded man in a torn World War II army uniform appears who introduces himself as Steve Rogers As the Avengers and Hydra search for fragments of the shattered Cube it is revealed that this amnesic Steve Rogers is actually a manifestation of Rogers existing within the Cube itself created by Kobiks memories of Rogers before he was converted to Hydra as she comes to recognize that her decision to rewrite Rogers as an agent of Hydra was wrong Although Hydra Rogers is able to mostly reassemble the Cosmic Cube Sam Wilson and Bucky are able to use a fragment of the cube to restore the memory of preHydra Rogers in the Cube to corporeal existence allowing him to defeat his Hydra self subsequently using the Cube to undo most of the damage caused by Hydra manipulating reality even if the physical damage remains Hydra Cap continues to exist as a separate entity and is kept trapped in a prison where he is the only inmate mocking the restored Rogers about the challenge he will face rebuilding his reputation even as Rogers muses that this experience will teach everyone not to place such blind trust in another    Powers and abilities     Tactician and field commander  Rogers battle experience and training make him an expert tactician and an excellent field commander with his teammates frequently deferring to his orders in battle Thor has stated that Rogers is one of the very few humans he will take orders from and follow through the gates of Hades Rogers reflexes and senses are extraordinarily keen He has blended Aikido Boxing Judo Karate Jujutsu Kickboxing and gymnastics into his own unique fighting style and is a master of multiple martial arts Years of practice with his nearindestructible shield make him able to aim and throw it with almost unerring accuracy His skill with his shield is such that he can attack multiple targets in succession with a single throw or even cause a boomeranglike return from a throw to attack an enemy from behind In canon he is regarded by other skilled fighters as one of the best handtohand combatants in the Marvel Universe limited only by his human physique Although the supersoldier serum is an important part of his strength Rogers has shown himself still sufficiently capable against stronger opponents even when the serum has been deactivated reverting him to his preCaptain America physiqueStan Lee claimed that hed always been fascinated by the fact that although Captain America has the least spectacular superpower of all the mantle of leadership falls naturally upon him as though he was born to command Cap is one of the hardest hero characters to write because the writer cannot use some exotic superpower to make his episodes seem colorful All he has to serve him are his extraordinary combat skills his shield and his unquenchable love for freedom and justiceRogers has vast US military knowledge and is often shown to be familiar with ongoing classified Defense Department operations He is an expert in combat strategy survival acrobatics parkour military strategy piloting and demolitions Despite his high profile as one of the worlds most popular and recognizable superheroes Rogers has a broad understanding of the espionage community largely through his ongoing relationship with SHIELD    SuperSoldier Serum  The SuperSoldier Serum enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the buildup of fatigue poisons in his muscles giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being This accounts for many of his extraordinary feats including bench pressing 1100 pounds 500 kg as a warmup and running a mile 16 km in less than a minute 60 mph97 kph nearly twice the maximum speed achieved by the best human sprinters Furthermore his enhancements are the reason why he was able to survive being frozen in suspended animation for decades He is highly resistant to hypnosis or gases that could limit his focus The secrets of creating a supersoldier were lost with the death of its creator Dr Abraham Erskine In the ensuing decades there have been numerous attempts to recreate Erskines treatment only to have them end in failure Even worse the attempts have instead often created psychopathic supervillains of which Captain Americas 1950s imitator and Nuke are the most notorious examples Steve Rodgers is often considered to be the pinnacle of human potential and operates at peak physical performance due to his enhancement via the Super Soldier Serum    Weapons and equipment   Captain America has used multiple shields throughout his history the most prevalent of which is a nighindestructible discshaped shield made from an experimental alloy of steel and the fictional vibranium The shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr Myron MacLain who was contracted by the US government from orders of President Franklin D Roosevelt to create an impenetrable substance to use for tanks during World War II This alloy was created by accident and never duplicated although efforts to reverseengineer it resulted in the discovery of adamantiumCaptain America often uses his shield as an offensive throwing weapon The first instance of Captain Americas trademark ricocheting shieldtoss occurs in Stan Lees first comics writing the twopage text story Captain America Foils the Traitors Revenge in Captain America Comics 3 May 1941 The legacy of the shield among other comics characters includes the timetraveling mutant superhero Cable telling Captain America that his shield still exists in one of the possible futures Cable carries it into battle and brandishes it as a symbolWhen without his trademark shield Captain America sometimes uses other shields made from less durable metals such as steel or even a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix Rogers having relinquished his regular shield to Barnes carried a variant of the energy shield which can be used with either arm and used to either block attacks or as an improvised offensive weapon able to cut through metal with relative ease Much like his Vibranium shield the energy shield can be thrown including ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to his handCaptain Americas uniform is made of a fireretardant material and he wears a lightweight bulletproof duralumin scale armor beneath his uniform for added protection Originally Rogers mask was a separate piece of material but an early engagement had it dislodged thus almost exposing his identity To prevent a recurrence of the situation Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck As a

Frightful Four battling the Fantastic Four He is also the first major Marvel villain to be written in publication history as battling Daredevil even being the founder and leader of the supervillain team that oppose him the Emissaries of Evil    Fictional character biography     Maxwell Dillon   While Maxwell Dillon an electrical engineer and lineman was repairing a power line a freak lightning accident caused a mutagenic change that transformed him into a living electrical capacitor His powers were initially weak so he spent some time stealing electrical equipment from Stark Industries to charge himself During this time he was approached by Magneto who considered him a potential recruit for his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants claiming that Dillons power rivaled his own but Dillon refused The following day Dillon was confronted by a smalltime thug from whom he had been borrowing money to pay for the machinery he had needed When the thug drew a gun on him because he had not paid back the money yet he responded by shooting a blast of lightning through the thugs chest—the first time Dillon ever killed anybody Soon taking the name Electro he turned to a life of a professional criminal his first victim being J Jonah Jameson Electro broke into the Daily Bugle Building and stole from Jamesons safe right in front of him Jameson accused SpiderMan of being an alternate identity of Electro prompting SpiderMan to prove the publisher wrong During their first ever confrontation SpiderMan was nearly killed after touching the electrically charged villain SpiderMan eventually used a fire hose to shortcircuit Electro while wearing rubber gloves to protect himselfElectro next confronted Daredevil for the first time when trying to break into the Baxter Building He was again defeated Electro later joined the original Sinister Six and was the first member of the group to fight SpiderMan battling him at a Stark plant when SpiderMan dodged a bolt of electricity he realized his powers had returned Electro lost his power when the power was cut off by SpiderMan SpiderMan got a card from him that led him to fight Kraven the Hunter Electro attacked the Fantastic Four at the wedding of Sue Storm and Reed Richards under the control of Doctor Dooms mindcontrol machine but due to Mister Fantastic he like the other villains has no memory of the incident He later recruited the second Emissaries of Evil in a plot of revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats This group consisted of Gladiator StiltMan LeapFrog and the MatadorElectro was later hired by J Jonah Jameson to defeat SpiderMan on national television He encountered Daredevil again in San Francisco at which time he temporarily donned a modified costume He then took control of a Protarian android seeking the destruction of Omega Electro then teamed with Blizzard against SpiderMan and Daredevil Electro then attempted to aid a band of criminals escaping the DefendersElectro later joined the Frightful Four As part of the Frightful Four he used SpiderMan as bait to trap the Fantastic Four Subsequently he battled the Falcon but was defeated partly because he did not consider the Falcon to be a serious threat Electro later learned that he can electrostatically disrupt SpiderMans wallcrawling ability The Chameleon and Hammerhead then sent the Shocker to try to recruit Electro into their organization Instead he later accepted Doctor Octopus invitation to rejoin the Sinister Six and battled SpiderManElectro has fought SpiderMan countless times either on his own or as part of a group such as the Sinister Six He has also fought such other heroes as Daredevil the Fantastic Four and the New Avengers Despite his immense power he has almost always been defeated usually as a result of his foes outsmarting him or taking advantage of his weakness to water while charged As a result of his frequent and often embarrassing defeats Electro tried to take over New York Citys power supply in an attempt at glory and respect SpiderMan thwarted this plan however and convinced Electro to quit his criminal career When Kaine SpiderMans insane clone started killing enemies of SpiderMan Electro began to fear for his life and temporarily joined Mysterios Sinister Seven which had been formed to combat Kaine This group was quickly disbanded and following Kaines subsequent disappearance Electro returned to retirement This changed when the Rose agreed to fund an experimental technique that would amplify Electros abilities in exchange for Electros services as an enforcer Seeing this as a chance to rise above the string of failures that had made up so much of his life Electro underwent the procedure After paying off his debt to the Rose by defeating several members of The True Believers an offshoot of the famous ninja sect called the Hand a group of ninja assassins who had been interfering in the Roses operations Electro attempted to demonstrate his newly amplified powers to the world once again attempting to take control of New York Citys power supply Wearing an insulated suit SpiderMan stopped him Electro in an effort to make a final grand gesture threw himself into the Hudson River while his body was highly charged seemingly killing himself in an explosion Somehow surviving Electro resurfaced later as part of the reformed Sinister Six formed to kill Senator Stewart Ward and Doctor Octopus whom the other members of the Six now hated due to his arrogance His powers had seemingly reverted to their preamplification level and he wore a new blueandwhite costume When Venom betrayed his fellow Sinister Six members attempting to kill them one by one he attacked Electro and left him for dead Once again Electro survived and when he next appeared had returned to his yellowand greencostume Electro was working with the Vulture when they were attacked by SpiderMan who thought they had kidnapped his Aunt May Electro managed to bring SpiderMan to the edge of defeat using his powers in more intelligent ways and blowing up a large number of cars including some with children in them After a devastating battle SpiderMan defeated him by fighting him to a gas refinery The badly wounded Electro recovered fairly quickly and shortly afterwards joined the Sinister Twelve assembled by the Green Goblin though he and the rest of the team was defeated thanks to the intervention of the Fantastic Four Daredevil Captain America Iron Man and Yellowjacket  Later separately he was hired by the Skrull Pagon posing as Elektra to free Karl Lykos also known as Sauron from The Raft a maximumsecurity prison for supervillains After causing a riot Electro tried to run away with his waitress girlfriend but was captured by the New Avengers subsequently fainting when faced with the prospect of being beaten up by Luke Cage using SpiderMans webbing to protect himself from ElectroLater Electro joined Chameleons Exterminators seeking to take advantage of Peter Parker and his loved ones During the Civil War storyline Electro was among the villains in Hammerheads unnamed villain army when Iron Man and SHIELD raided the hideoutIn Secret Invasion Electro appears as member of Hoods crime syndicate and attacked a Skrull force After the Skrull posing as Jarvis kidnaps the baby of Luke Cage and Jessica Jones the Avengers and the Fantastic Four begin going after everyone who is associated with the Skrulls Because of this Electro is confronted by Wolverine in an alley where after a battle he leaves Dillon beaten and unconsciousElectro returns in The Gauntlet with a new look as his face is now scarred with lightning bolts The revamp was explained by writer Mark Waid stating that artist Paul Azaceta tweaked the design a bit adding some burn scars to reflect Electros current situation As Electro gets older as his body chemistry starts to shift into middle age his powers are becoming more erratic and less easy for him to control So he turns to a surprise Marvel villain – someone rarely if ever seen in the pages of Amazing – to level up During his appearance in The Guantlet it is revealed that Electro has lost control over his powers besides the physical disfigurement his touch is now 100 lethal Depressed and angry at the world because of this Electro begins gathering other outcasts and misfits into a group known as Power To The People which targets rightwing newspaper baron Dexter Bennett and the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of the 2008 Financial Crisis Electros group manages to gain positive coverage in the media hampering SpiderMans ability to convince Electros followers of his true evil nature Electros duplicitous nature causes him to betray his followers in order to align with the amoral Bennett in exchange for help finding a way to restore his powers to a controllable level The Mad Thinker is able to come up with a process to cure Electro but SpiderMan interferes with the process turning Electro into an artificial electrical thunderbolt Furious Electro doublecrosses Bennett and ultimately uses his new powers to destroy The DB building crippling Bennett in the process In doing so Electro uses up so much of his newfound power that SpiderMan is able to neutralize him with his webbing In the epilogue Electro runs into Sasha Kravinoff and Chameleon in his new jail cell In the following issue involving Sandman it is revealed that Electro has escaped Under the orders of the Kravinoffs he breaks the Vulture Jimmy Natale out of prisonDuring the Heroic Age storyline it is suspected by the Young Allies that Electro had a discarded and disavowed daughter named Aftershock similar to the MC2 Universe version who is a member of the Bastards of Evil When Young Allies members Firestar and Gravity fight Electro he defeats them and lets them live so that they can spread the message that he does not endorse Aftershock and the Bastards of Evils terrorism He also says they can look up how and when he got his powers on the internet and there was no way a girl of Aftershocks age could have been conceived after he got his powers Its impossible for him to be Aftershocks fatherElectro is later present at the scene where Mattie Franklin is sacrificed by Sasha Kravinoff as part of a ritual that resurrects Vladimir Kravinoff as a large humanoid lion creatureDuring the Origin of the Species storyline Electro is among the supervillains invited by Doctor Octopus to join his supervillain team where they are promised that they will receive a reward in exchange for securing some specific items Electro goes after SpiderMan for Menaces infant Anticipating SpiderMans plan to deliver the infant to a hospital Electro waits at the nearest hospital in SpiderMans area until SpiderMan shows up The two begin to battle until Sandman interferes and SpiderMan tricks Electro into electrocuting Sandman turning him into glass Flying shards of glass hit Electro temporarily stunning him and allowing SpiderMan to escape SpiderMan goes on an angry rampage against all the villains after the Chameleon tricks him into thinking the infant is dead He defeats Electro in Vinegar Hill BrooklynIn the Big Time storyline Electro becomes a member of Doctor Octopus new Sinister Six and helps Chameleon break into an air force base in New Jersey Electro was with the Sinister Six when it came to fighting Intelligencia During a conflict between the Intelligencia and the Sinister Six Mad Thinker was able to briefly deactivate Electros powers but was caught offguard when Electro physically attacked him instead the surprise of the attack allowed Electro to defeat Mad Thinker During the Ends of the Earth storyline despite the Sinister Six being prepared for a fight with the Avengers Electro was the first of the team to be defeated being hurled into the upper atmosphere by Thor while distracted by his inability to attack SpiderMans new hitech armorElectro returns to Earth and attempts to avenge himself on Thor by forcing an AIM scientist to convert him to generate protons instead of electrons but he is defeated when Superior SpiderMan Doctor Octopus mind in SpiderMans body manages to convert him into a stream of protons and traps him Superior SpiderMan places Electro in containment next to Sandman in his hidden underwater lab Electro Chameleon Sandman Mysterion and the Vulture are later seen as part of a team led by Superior SpiderMan called the Superior Six Superior SpiderMan has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes He does this by forcing them to do heroic deeds against their will some of which almost get them killed Every time he is done controlling them he puts them back in their containment cells They eventually break free of Superior SpiderMans control and attempt to exact revenge on the wallcrawler nearly destroying New York in order to do so With the help of Sun Girl Superior SpiderMan is barely able to stop the Superior SixElectro was seen battling the Punisher in Los Angeles CaliforniaFollowing the conclusion of The Superior SpiderMan storyline returning the true SpiderMan Electro comes into the Bar With No Name and is introduced to the Hobgoblins servants by his friend and bartender Deke The villains start joking about the gloomy Electro One mentions how Thor launched him into space Another about how SpiderMan made him part of the Superior Six And yet another about how Electro was taken out by the Punisher despite the latters lack of powers Electro gets angry and starts sparking but the bartender gets the situation under control by commenting on how bad the Punisher is and with compliments like breaking so many villains out of the Raft which earned him the respect of Crossbones and Count Nefaria This does not stop the others however Determined to get respect Electro heads back over to the Raft ready for another breakout despite Green Goblin having done the same just recently and the fact that it was rechristened as SpiderIsland II He sends a blot of electricity around but it grows excessively big and Electro cannot turn it off He finally exhausts all of his power but when this happens he passes out and many of the villains he tried to break out are now dead Vowing revenge Electro soon realizes what caused this to happen to him experiments conducted by SpiderMan Electro later visits his friend Francine Frye and keeps his distance because of his uncontrollable powers Francine starts to kiss Electro only to end up dying from electrocution At Peter Parkers behest Parker Industries is testing out an antiElectro netting that can capture Electro Electro is later seen with Black Cat when they raid Eels hideout where Electro defeats Eel Electro and Black Cat later crash the meeting between Mister Negative and Phil Urich who is leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the selfproclaimed Goblin King where they throw Eels body into the area where the meeting is During Peter Parkers interview on the Fact Channel Electro attacks the security team on the channel and Black Cat arrives announcing her demand that if SpiderMan does not show up in fifteen minutes Peter Parker will be dead Electro complains about the plan but Black Cat stays determined that SpiderMan will show up but then Silk arrives to confront them both giving Peter the time to change into SpiderMan and jump into action aiding Silk As she battles against Electro and SpiderMan deals with Black Cat J Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action Electro fails to stop Silk but Black Cat redirects one of Electros bolts into hitting SpiderMan knocking him down in the process Electro pressures Sajani into telling him how effective the AntiElectro traps will be in removing his powers but Black Cat interrupts their talk in order to ask her how the device works They both infiltrate the demonstration suiting Electro into the Fake Electro costume while Black Cat disguises herself as one of the operators Black Cat start the machine further enhancing Electros power only to be interrupted by SpiderMan and Silk Electro tries to escape but his insulated webbing protects him by allowing Silk to cover Electro with her webbing Black Cat changes the plan using the wiring to overload Electro by putting his powers way out of control shooting his lightning bolts against the helicopter Silk saves the helicopter and SpiderMan jumps into the machine using his webbing to cover Electro in order to take him out of there Electro asks to let go but SpiderMan remains determined to hold him until they are both saved by Silk who pulls them out of the machine and away from the explosion which failed to kill SpiderMan as Black Cat wanted and she escapes However Electro was apparently depowered and taken into custodyAs part of the AllNew AllDifferent Marvel event a depowered Maxwell Dillon was shown as an inmate at Andry Corrections Facility alongside Lizard Upon being sprung out of the prison by Rhino he meets a mysterious redsuited man who offers to restore Electros powers in exchange for his services Jackal and Lizard work on the procedure that would repower Maxwell Dillon When Dillon was reluctant to go through with the procedure Jackal brings in a woman who Dillon recognizes as Francine Frye minus the piercings and tattoos that are on her body Dillon agrees to go ahead with the procedure The Jackal cloned Francine from DNA taken from her charred cheek Francine observes the Jackals attempt to restore Dillons powers but the experiment fails charging his suit but not his body Unexpectedly the DNA in Dillons saliva that was mixed in with Francines own DNA attracts the electrical energy to Francine Desiring more Francine leans in to kiss Dillon and kills him in the process while absorbing his powers as the resulting action burns Dillons body    Francine Frye   Francine Frye is a woman who is a fan of supervillains At some point she befriended Electro At the time when Electro was losing control of his abilities she was visited by him When attempting to kiss Electro Francine died from electrocutionJackal later revived her as a clone lacking her piercings and tattoos She was summoned by Jackal to help persuade Electro to go through with the procedure that would repower himIt turned out that Electros saliva was mixed in with Francines DNA which led to her kissing Dillon enough to kill him and becoming the second Electro She later encountered Prowler at the time when he infiltrated New U Technologies During the chase Electro accidentally caused the apparent death of Prowler causing Jackal to make a clone of himDuring the Dead No More The Clone Conspiracy storyline Francine assists Rhino into attacking SpiderMan when he infiltrates New U Technologies Both of them are defeated When Prowler has not returned from his mission to Alcatraz the villains he cloned start fighting again enough for Jackal to send Francine to have Madame Webs clone find Prowler Francine shocks the answers out of Madame Webs clone as Julia Carpenter feels it on her end After Julia Carpenter escapes Francine confronts Prowler as his body starts failing Prowler tries to escape Francines wrath in Alcatraz which proves difficult with her powers and his dying body Using his weapons the gift shop and his strategic thinking Prowler manages to defeat the simpleminded Francine When Jackals police contact Chief Anderson tells him about where the clone of Gwen Stacy is Jackal sends Rhino and Electro to Horizon University When they retrieve the Gwen Stacy clone she tells them to bring Kaine due to his encounter with the Carrion Virus might help in Jackals research Anna Marie Marconi persuades them to bring her along too since she also studied Kaine and the drug Both villains agree to the terms Electro later assists Doctor Octopus into fighting Spectro following his failed attempt to make off with a test subject where she is able to knock him out Alongside Kaine Electro was being studied by Doctor Octopus in order to find out how to perfect the Proto Clone When SpiderWoman of Earth65 tries to free Kaine she is attacked by Electro When SpiderWoman of Earth65 leaves Prowler in an alley when he proves to weak to continue he is found by Electro Julia Carpenter arrives and fends Electro off as she tells Prowler that SpiderMans stabilized the human and clone cells When Electro gets the upper hand on Julia Prowler sacrifices himself to stop Electro and dies in Julias arms Electro is one of the few clones that was able to survive the inverse frequency and got awayElectro later appears as a member of the Sinister Six led by Aaron Davis in a recolored Iron Spider armor She accompanied them in their mission to steal a decommissioned SHIELD Helicarrier    Powers and abilities  An unusually configured magnetic field was created when Max Dillon was struck by lightning while holding live hightension wires and a wound reel of oneinch cable granting him superhuman powers Electro can generate massive quantities of electricity theoretically up to approximately one million volts He can employ this electrostatic energy as lightning arcs from his fingertips and his maximum charge is more than enough to kill a normal human When his body is charged to high levels he becomes superhumanly strong and fast He can also glide over power lines by using the electricity contained therein for propulsion and he has on occasion been shown to actually ride on lightning bolts During a stint in prison Doctor Octopus gave him the ideas of ionizing metals and sparking the petroleum in the fuel tank of a vehicle as a way to generate explosions He can charge himself up to make himself more powerful He can also absorb the energy of electrical equipment such as a power plant to increase his powers further In New Avengers he was shown to fly and manipulate large amounts of electricity and machinery when he freed all the prisoners at Rykers IslandAn experimental procedure heightened his powers allowing Electro to store and absorb a seemingly limitless amount of electricity He also seemed to gain the power over magnetism to a certain degree allowing him to manipulate magnetic fields and move objects in a manner similar to that of Magneto and could overcome his old weakness to water by using the electromagnetic fields around him to vaporize water before it could touch him He made SpiderMan beg by stimulating the bioelectric currents in his brain and was able to defeat Nate Grey by manipulating said currents in Nates brain to turn his own psionic powers against him Electro can override any electrically powered device and manipulate it according to his mental commands By using an external electrical power source to recharge his bodys energy reserves Electro could expend electricity indefinitely without diminishing his personal reserves When he is fully charged Electro is extremely sensitive to anything that may short circuit him such as water Electro propels himself along magnetic lines of force in objects that have great electrical potential such as hightension electrical lines He can also create electrostatic bridges to traverse upon at the cost of a great expenditure of energy During the events of the storyline The Gauntlet Electro became a living artificial thunderbolt allowing him to travel through electrical appliances such as going through a light bulb and exiting through any other electronic device connected to the power source He was also able to transmit himself over SpiderMans web   ',\n",
